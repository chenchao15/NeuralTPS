## Setup

### Installation

Create virtual environment: 

```
python -m venv neuraltps_venv
source neuraltps_venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, for evaluation of the models, complie the extension modules, which are provided by [Occupancy Networks](https://github.com/autonomousvision/occupancy_networks). run:

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

To compile the dmc extension, you have to have a cuda enabled device set up. If you experience any errors, you can simply comment out the `dmc_*` dependencies in `setup.py`. You should then also comment out the `dmc` imports in `im2mesh/config.py`.

Finally, for calculating chamfer distance faster during training, we use the Customized TF Operator `nn_distance`, run:

```
cd nn_distance
./tf_nndistance_compile.sh
```

## Dataset

You can download our preprocessed ShapeNet dataset. Put all folders in `data`.

## Training and Evaluation

Training and evaluating single 3d object:

```
./run.sh
```
